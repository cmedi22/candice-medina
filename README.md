## Coding Experience
Not much, but when Covid started and we were in lockdown, I tried to learn CSS, but I didn't get far, and I forget the language. Also in the summer before 9th grade, I programmed a Raspberry PI with C++ (I think that's the right language) for a coding camp at my old middle school.

## Why Am I Taking this Class
I needed a fifth core academic class, and I saw this class and wanted to try it out because it was the  most interesting one that could fit into my schedule.

## Other Interests
I run cross country in the fall, snowboard in the winter, and run mid to long distance in track. I am also a seasonal snowboard instructor during thew winter, of course. I also like being in technical theatre, my art for this year, which is very similar to stage crew. We basically run shows and performances in the background while performers perform. I also picked up skateboarding recently. I like to embroider things on clothing, and I teach myself to play various instruments.

## Goals
I don't have many goals, but my main one is to just have the basics of coding down in my head, because I've tried coding on my own and never really commit, so I never remember how to code when I come back to it. So I hope I will be able to have the foundations of coding down and hopefully remember them by the end of the year.

## Worries/Fears
I also don't have many worries or fears. But if I had to be afraid of something, I would worry that if we were to learn something in class about coding, it won't click in my head and I won't understand what's happening.
